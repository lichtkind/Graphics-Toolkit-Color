    $red->gradient( to => '#0000FF', steps => 10);   # 10 colors from red to blue
    my @base_triadic = $red->complement( 3 );        # get fitting red green and blue
    my @reds = $red->cluster( radius => 4, distance => 1 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Graphics::Toolkit::Color, for short B<GTC>, is the top level API of this
release and the only package a regular user should be concerned with.
Its main purpose is the creation of related colors or sets of them,
such as gradients, complements and others. But you can use it also to
convert and/or reformat color definitions.

GTC are read only, one color representing objects with no additional
dependencies. Create them in many different ways (see L</CONSTRUCTOR>).
Access its values via methods from section L</GETTER>.
Measure differences with the L</distance> method. L</SINGLE-COLOR>
methods create one new object that is related to the current one and
L</COLOR-SETS> methods will create a group of colors, that are not
only related to the current color but also have relations between each other.
Error messages will appear as return values instead of the expected result.

While this module can understand and output color values to many
L<color spaces|Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Space::Hub/COLOR-SPACES>,
L<RGB|Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Space::Hub/RGB>
is the (internal) primal one, because GTC is about colors that can be
shown on the screen, and these are usually encoded in I<RGB>.
Humans access colors on hardware level (eye) in I<RGB>, on cognition level
in I<HSL> (brain) and on cultural level (language) with names.
Having easy access to all of those plus some color math and many formats
should enable you to get the color palette you desire quickly.


=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

There are many options to create a color object. In short you can either
use the name of a constant (see L</name>) or provide values, which are
coordinates in one of several
L<color spaces|Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Space::Hub/COLOR-SPACES>.
The latter are also understood in many
L<formats|Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Space::Hub/FORMATS>.
From now on any input that the constructor method C<new> accepts,
is called a B<color definition>.


=head2 new({ r => $r, g => $g, b => $b })

Most clear, flexible and longest input format: a hash with long or short
axis names as keys with fitting values. This can be C<red>, C<green> and
C<blue> or C<r>, C<g> and C<b> or names from any other color space.
Upper or lower case doesnt matter.

    my $red = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new( r => 255, g => 0, b => 0 );
    my $red = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new({r => 255, g => 0, b => 0}); # works too
                        ... ->new( Red => 255, Green => 0, Blue => 0);   # also fine
              ... ->new( Hue => 0, Saturation => 100, Lightness => 50 ); # same color
                  ... ->new( Hue => 0, whiteness => 0, blackness => 0 ); # still the same


=head2 new( [$r, $g, $b] )

takes a triplet of integer I<RGB> values (red, green and blue : 0 .. 255).
They can, but don't have to be put into an ARRAY reference (square brackets).
If you want to define a color by values from another color space,
you have to prepend the values with the name of a supported color space.
Out of range values will be corrected (clamped).

    my $red = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new(         255, 0, 0 );
    my $red = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new(        [255, 0, 0]); # does the same
    my $red = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new( 'RGB',  255, 0, 0 ); # named ARRAY syntax
    my $red = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new(  RGB => 255, 0, 0 ); # with fat comma
    my $red = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new([ RGB => 255, 0, 0]); # and brackets


=head2 new('rgb($r,$g,$b)')

String format that is supported by CSS (I<css_string> format): it starts
with the case insensitive color space name (lower case is default),
followed by the comma separated values in round braces.
The value suffixes that are defined by the color space (I<'%'> in case
of I<HSV>) are optional.

    my $red = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new( 'rgb(255, 0, 0)' );
    my $blue = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new( 'hsv(240, 100%, 100%)' );


=head2 new('rgb: $r, $g, $b')

String format I<named_string> (good for serialisation) that maximizes
readability.

    my $red = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new( 'rgb: 255, 0, 0' );
    my $blue = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new( 'HSV: 240, 100, 100' );


=head2 new('#rgb')

Color definitions in hexadecimal format as widely used in the web, are
also acceptable (I<RGB> only).

    my $color = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new('#FF0000');
    my $color = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new('#f00');    # short works too


=head2 new('name')

Get a color object by providing a name from the X11, HTML (CSS) or SVG
scheme or a Pantone report. UPPER or CamelCase will be normalized to
lower case and inserted underscore letters ('_') will be ignored as perl
does in numbers (1_000 == 1000). All available names are listed
L<here | Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Name::Constant/NAMES>.

    my $color = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new('Emerald');
    my @names = Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Name::all(); # select from these


=head2 new('scheme:color')

Get a color by name from a specific scheme or standard as provided by an
external module L<Graphics::ColorNames>::* , which has to be installed
separately. * is a placeholder for the scheme name, which might be:
Crayola, CSS, EmergyC, GrayScale, HTML, IE, Mozilla, Netscape, Pantone,
PantoneReport, SVG, VACCC, Werner, Windows, WWW or X. In latter case
I<Graphics::ColorNames::X> has to be installed. You can get them all at
once via L<Bundle::Graphics::ColorNames>.
The color name will be  normalized as above.

    my $color = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new('SVG:green');
    my @schemes = Graphics::ColorNames::all_schemes();      # look up the installed


=head2 color

If writing

    Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new( ...);

is too much typing work for you or takes up to much space in the code file,
import the subroutine C<color>, which accepts all the same arguments as C<new>.

    use Graphics::Toolkit::Color qw/color/;
    my $green = color('green');
    my $darkblue = color([20, 20, 250]);



=head1 GETTER

giving access to different parts of the objects data.


=head2 values

Returns the numeric values of the color, held by the object.
The method accepts five optional, named arguments:
L</in> (color space), C<as> (format), L</range>, C<precision> and C<suffix>.
In most cases, only the first one is needed.

When given no arguments, the method returns a list with the integer
values: C<red>, C<green> and C<blue> in 0..255 range, since I<RGB> is the
default color space of this module.

If one argument is provided, the values get converted into the given color space.
The same is done when using the named argument L</in> (see more behind the link).
The also reoccurring argument L</range> is explained in its own section too.
Please note you have to use the C<range> argument only, if you like to
deviate from the value ranges defined by the chosen color space.

The maybe most characteristic argument for this method is C<as>, which
enables the same formats the constructor method C<new> accepts, since
I<GTC> is built with the design principle of total serialisation -
meaning every output can be evaluated back into a color object and any
intput can be serialized into an output. To every format: C<list> (default),
C<named_array>, C<hash>, C<char_hash>, C<named_string>, C<css_string>,
C<array> (RGB only) and C<hex_string> (RGB only) is an example below.
Format names are case insensitive. For more explanations, please see:
L<formats|Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Space::Hub/FORMATS>.

C<precision> is more exotic but sometimes you need to escape the numeric
precision, set by a color spaces definition.
For instance C<LAB> values will have maximally three decimals, no matter
how precise the input was. In case you prefer 4 decimals, just use
C<precision =E<gt> 4>. A zero means no decimals and -1 stands for maximal
precision -  which can spit out more decimals than you prefer.
Different precisions per axis ([1,2,3]) are possible.

In same way you can atach a little string per value by ussing the C<suffix>
aregument. Normally these are percentage signs but in some spaces, where
they appear by default you can surpress them by adding C<suffix =E<gt> ''>

    $blue->values();                                    # 0, 0, 255
    $blue->values( in => 'RGB', as => 'list');          # 0, 0, 255 # explicit arguments
    $blue->values(              as => 'array');         # [0, 0, 255] - RGB only
    $blue->values( in => 'RGB', as => 'named_array');   # ['RGB', 0, 0, 255]
    $blue->values( in => 'RGB', as => 'hash');          # { red => 0, green => 0, blue => 255}
    $blue->values( in => 'RGB', as => 'char_hash');     # { r => 0, g => 0, b => 255}
    $blue->values( in => 'RGB', as => 'named_string');  # 'rgb: 0, 0, 255'
    $blue->values( in => 'RGB', as => 'css_string');    # 'rgb( 0, 0, 255)'
    $blue->values(              as => 'hex_string');    # '#0000ff' - RGB only
    $blue->values(           range => 2**16 );          # 0, 0, 65536
    $blue->values('HSL');                               # 240, 100, 50
    $blue->values( in => 'HSL',suffix => ['', '%','%']);# 240, '100%', '50%'
    $blue->values( in => 'HSB',  as => 'hash')->{'hue'};# 240
   ($blue->values( 'HSB'))[0];                          # 240
    $blue->values( in => 'XYZ', range => 1, precision => 2);# normalized, 2 decimals max.


=head2 name

Returns the normalized name string (lower case, without I<'_'>) that
represents the I<RGB> values of this color in the default color scheme,
which is I<X11> + I<HTML> (I<SVG>) + I<Pantone report>
(see L<all names|Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Name::Constant/NAMES>).
These are the same who can be used with L</new('name')>.

Alternatively you may provide named arguments or one positional argument,
which requires the same input as the named argument C<from>. It names one
or a list of color schemes, from which the name will be selected then.
Your otions are C<CSS>, C<Crayola>, C<EmergyC>, C<GrayScale>, C<HTML>,
C<IE>, C<Mozilla>, C<Netscape>, C<Pantone>, C<PantoneReport>, C<SVG>,
C<VACCC>, C<Werner>, C<Windows>, C<WWW> and C<X> plus self created naming
schemes (see L<Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Name::Scheme>). Please note
that all listed schemes are parts of modules that have to be installed
separately. For your convenience I created the module
L<Bundle::Graphics::ColorNames> to install them all at once. If you
try to use a scheme from a not installed module your will get an error
message instead of a color name.

The second named argument is C<all>, which needs to be a perly boolean.
It defaults to false. But when set to 1 you will get a list of all names
that are associated with the current values. There will be no duplicates,
when several schemes are searched.

A third named argument is C<full>, also needing a perly boolean, that
defaults to false. When set C<true> (1), the schema is part of the returned
color name. These full names are also accepted by the constructor.

    $blue->name();                                   # 'blue'
    $blue->name('SVG');                              # 'blue'
    $blue->name( from => [qw/CSS X/], all => 1);     # 'blue', 'blue1'
    $blue->name( from => 'CSS', full => 1);          # 'CSS:blue'


=head2 closest_name

Works almost identical as method L</name>, but guarantees a none empty
result, unless invoking a weird empty color scheme - the method returns
scalar context a color name, which has the shortest L</distance> in I<RGB>
to the current color. In list context, you get additionally the just
mentioned distance as a second return value.

All arguments work as mentioned above. The only difference (due to the
second return value), multiple names (when requested) have to come in the
form of an ARRAY (as the first return value).

    my $name = $red_like->closest_name;              # closest name in default scheme
    my $name = $red_like->closest_name('HTML');      # closest HTML constant
    ($red_name, $distance) = $red_like->closest_name;


=head2 distance

Is a floating point number that measures the Euclidean distance between
two colors, which represent two points in a color space. One color
is the calling object itself and the second one has to be provided as
either the only argument or the named argument L</to>, which is the only
required one.

The C<distance> is measured in I<RGB> color space unless told otherwise
by the argument L</in>. Please use the I<CIELAB> or I<CIELUV> space, if
you are interested in getting a result that matches the human perception.

The third argument is named C<select>. It's useful if you want to regard
only certain dimensions (axis). For instance if you want to know only
the difference in brightness between two colors, you type
C<select =E<gt> 'lightness'> or C<select =E<gt> 'l'>. This works of course only
if you choose I<HSL> or something similar like I<LAB> as color space.
Long or short axis names are accepted, but they all have to come from one
color space. You also can mention one axis several times for heightened
emphasis on this dimension.

The last argument is named L</range>, which can change the result drasticly.

    my $d = $blue->distance( 'lapisblue' );                 # how close is blue to lapis?
    $d = $blue->distance( to => 'airyblue', select => 'b'); # have they the same amount of blue?
    $d = $color->distance( to => $c2, in => 'HSL', select => 'hue' );  # same hue?
    $d = $color->distance( to => $c2, range => 'normal' );  # distance with values in 0 .. 1 range
    $d = $color->distance( to => $c2, select => [qw/r g b b/]); # double the weight of blue value differences



=head1 SINGLE COLOR

These methods generate one new color object that is related to the calling
object (invocant). You might expect that methods like C<set_value> change
the values of the invocant, but GTC objects are as mentioned in the
L</DESCRIPTION> read only. That supports a more functional programming
style as well as method stacking like:

    $color->add_value( saturation => 5)->invert->mix( to => 'green');


=head2 set_value

Creates a new GTC color object that shares some values with the current one,
but differs in others. The altered values are provided as absoltue numbers.
If the resulting color will be outside of the given color space, the values
will be clamped so it will become a regular color of that space.

The axis of
L<all supported color spaces|Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Space::Hub/COLOR-SPACES>
have long and short names. For instance I<HSL> has I<hue>, I<sturation>
and I<lightness>. The short equivalents are I<h>, I<s> and I<l>. This
method accepts these axis names as named arguments and disregards if
characters are written upper or lower case. This method can not work,
if you mix axis names from different spaces or choose one axis more than once.
One solvable issue is when axis in different spaces have the same name.
For instance I<HSL> and I<HSV> have a I<saturation> axis. To disambiguate
you can add the named argument L</in>.

    my $blue = $black->set_value( blue => 255 );              # same as #0000ff
    my $pale_blue = $blue->set_value( saturation => 50 );        # ->( s => 50) works too
    my $color = $blue->set_value( saturation => 50, in => 'HSV' );  # previous was HSL


=head2 add_value

Creates a new GTC color object that shares some values with the current one,
but differs in others. The altered values are provided relative to the current
ones. The rest works as described in L</set_value>.
This method was mainly created to get lighter, darker or more saturated
colors by using it like:


    my $blue = Graphics::Toolkit::Color->new('blue');
    my $darkblue = $blue->add_value( Lightness => -25 );  # get a darker tone
    my $blue2 = $blue->add_value( blue => 10 );           # bluer than blue ?
    my $blue3 = $blue->add_value( l => 10, in => 'LAB' ); # lighter color according CIELAB


=head2 mix

Create a new GTC object, that has the average values
between the calling object and another color (or several colors).
It accepts three named arguments: L</to>, C<amount> and L</in>, but only
the first one is required.

L</to> works like in other methods, with the exception that it also
accepts an ARRAY ref (square brackets) with several color definitions.

Per default I<mix> computes a 50-50 (1:1) mix. In order to change that,
employ the C<amount> argument, which is the weight the mixed in color(s)
get, counted in percentages. The remaining percentage to 100 is the weight
of the color, held by the caller object. This would be naturally nothing,
if the C<amount> is greater than hundret, which is especially something
to consider, if mixing more than two colors. Then both C<to> and C<amount>
have to get an array of colors and respectively their amounts (same order).
Obviously both arrays MUST have the same length. If the sum of amounts is
greater than 100 the original color is ignored but the weight ratios will
be kept. You may actually give C<amount> a scalar value while mixing a list
of colors. Then the amount is applied to every color mentioned under the
C<to> argument. In this case you go over the sum of 100% very quickly.

    $blue->mix( 'silver');                                         # 50% silver, 50% blue
    $blue->mix( to => 'silver', amount => 60 );                    # 60% silver, 40% blue
    $blue->mix( to => [qw/silver green/], amount => [10, 20]);     # 10% silver, 20% green, 70% blue
    $blue->mix( to => [qw/silver green/] );                        # 50% silver, 50% green
    $blue->mix( to => {H => 240, S =>100, L => 50}, in => 'RGB' ); # teal


=head2 invert

Computes the a new color object, where all values are inverted according
to the ranges of the chosen color space (see L</in>). It takes only one
optional, positional argument, a space name.

    my $black = $white->invert();         # to state the obvious
    my $blue = $yellow->invert( 'LUV' );  # invert in LUV space
    $yellow->invert( in => 'LUV' );       # would work too



=head1 COLOR SETS

construct several interrelated color objects at once.


=head2 complement

Creates a set of complementary colors (GTC objects), which will be
computed in I<HSL> color space. The method accepts three optional,
named arguments: C<steps> and C<tilt> and C<target>. But if none are
provided, THE (one) complementary color will be produced.

One singular, positional argument defines the number of produced colors,
same as the named argument C<steps> would have. If you want to get
'triadic' colors, choose 3 as an argument for C<steps> - 4 would get
you the 'tetradic' colors, .... and so on. The given color is always
the last in the row of produced complementary colors.

If you need split-complementary colors, just use the C<tilt> argument,
which defaults to zero. Without any tilt, complementary colors are equally
distanced dots on a horizontal circle around the vertical, central column
in I<HSL> space. In other words: complementary colors have all the same
'saturation' (distance from the column) and 'lightness' (height).
They differ only in 'hue' (position on the circle). The given color
and its (THE) complement sit on opposite sides of the circle.
The greater the C<tilt> amount, the more these colors (minus the given
one) will move on the circle toward THE complement and vice versa.
What is traditionally meant by split-complementary colors you will
get here with a C<tilt> factor of around 3.42 and three C<steps> or
a C<tilt> of 1.585 and four C<steps> (depending on if you need
THE complement also in your set).

To get an even greater variety of complementary colors, you can use
C<target> argument and move around THE complement and thus shape the
circle in all three directions. C<hue> (or C<h>) values move it
circularly C<saturation> (or C<s>) move it away or negative values toward
the central column and C<lightness> (or C<l>) move it up and down.

    my @colors = $c->complement( 4 );                       # 'tetradic' colors
    my @colors = $c->complement( steps => 4, tilt => 4 );   # split-complementary colors
    my @colors = $c->complement( steps => 3, tilt => { move => 2, target => {l => -10}} );
    my @colors = $c->complement( steps => 3, tilt => { move => 2,
                                                     target => { h => 20, s=> -5, l => -10 } });


=head2 gradient

Creates a gradient (a list of color objects that build a transition)
between the current color held by the object and a second color,
provided by the named argument L</to>, which is  required.
Optionally C<to> accepts an ARRAY ref (square braces) with a list of
colors in order to create the most fancy, custom and nonlinear gradients.

Also required is the named argument C<steps>, which is the gradient length
or count of colors, which are part of this gradient. Included in there
are the start color (given by this object) and end color (given with C<to>).

The optional, floating point valued argument C<tilt> makes the gradient
skewed toward one or the other end. Default is zero, which results in
a linear, uniform transition between start and stop.
Greater values of the argument let the color change rate start small,
steadily getting bigger. Negative values work vice versa.
The bigger the absolute numeric value the bigger the effect. Please have
in mind that values over 2 result is a very strong tilt.

Optional is the named argument L</in> (color space - details behind link).
Tip: use C<oklab> and C<cieluv> spaces for visually smooth gradients.

    # we turn to grey
    my @colors = $c->gradient( to => $grey, steps => 5);
    # none linear gradient in HSL space :
    @colors = $c1->gradient( to =>[14,10,222], steps => 10, tilt => 1, in => 'HSL' );
    @colors = $c1->gradient( to =>['blue', 'brown', {h => 30, s => 44, l => 50}] );


=head2 cluster

Computes a set of colors that are all similar but not the same.
The method accepts three named arguments: C<radius>, C<distance> and L</in>,
of which the first two are required.

The produced colors form a ball or cuboid in a color space around the given
color, depending on what the argument C<radius> got. If it is a single
number, it will be a ball with the given radius. If it is an ARRAY of
values you get the a cuboid with the given dimensions.

The minimal distance between any two colors of a cluster is set by the
C<distance> argument, which is computed the same way as the method
L</distance>. In a cuboid shaped cluster- the colors will form a cubic
grid - inside the ball shaped cluster they form a cuboctahedral grid,
which is packed tighter, but still obeys the minimal distance.

    my @blues = $blue->cluster( radius => 4, distance => 0.3 );
    my @c = $color->cluster( radius => [2,2,3], distance => 0.4, in => YUV );



=head1 ARGUMENTS

Some named arguments of the above listed methods reappear in several methods.
Thus they are explained here once. Please note that you must NOT wrap
the named args in curly braces (HASH ref).


=head2 in

The named argument I<in> expects the name of a color space as
L<listed here|Graphics::Toolkit::Color::Space::Hub/COLOR-SPACES>.
The default color space in this module is I<RGB>. Depending on the chosen
space, the results of all methods can be very different, since colors
are arranged there very differently and have different distances to each
other. Some colors might not even exist in some spaces.


=head2 range

Every color space comes with range definitions for its values.
For instance I<red>, I<green> and I<blue> in I<RGB> go usually from zero
to 255 (0..255). In order to change that, many methods accept the named
argument C<range>. When only one interger value provided, it changes the
upper bound on all three axis and as lower bound is assumed zero.
Let's say you need I<RGB16> values with a range of 0 .. 65536,
then you type C<< range => 65536 >> or C<< range => 2**16 >>.

If you provide an ARRAY ref you can change the upper bounds of all axis
individually and in order to change even the lower boundaries, use ARRAY
refs even inside that. For instance in C<HSL> the C<hue> is normally
0 .. 359 and the other two axis are 0 .. 100. In order to set C<hue>
to -100 .. 100 but keep the other two untouched you would have to insert:
C<< range => [[-100,100],100,100] >>.


=head2 to

This argument receives a second or target color. It may come in form of
another GTC object or a color definition that is acceptable to the
